# smart-glob

`smart-glob` is the only nodejs glob searcher that does not recurse inside every directory it finds

This is useful when you want to ignore certain folders from being scanned like `node_modules`

In [bump-version](https://github.com/remorses/bump-version) github action i reduced the glob search time form 50 seconds down to 13 seconds

```
npm i smart-glob
```

## Benchmark
